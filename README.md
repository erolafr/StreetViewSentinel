Street View Sentinel: Early Detection and Mapping for Smarter Biodiversity Management

â€‹Invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity, disrupting ecosystems and outcompeting native species. Monitoring and managing them, however, is resource-intensive and challenging due to the high costs of field surveys. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and remote sensing offer promising solutions to improve the detection and mapping of invasive plants. This project will develop an AI-driven tool for the detection and mapping of invasive species, specifically focusing on Opuntia ficus-indica (prickly pear) in Sicily. By using Google Street View (GSV) images and deep learning, this project aims to demonstrate how AI can improve biodiversity management strategies.

This project is funded by the British Ecological Society (Small Research 2025 - SR25/1260) awarded to Dr. Erola Fenollosa.
